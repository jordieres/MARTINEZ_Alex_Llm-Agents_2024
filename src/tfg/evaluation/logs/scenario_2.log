HumanMessage: Retrieve the average outdoor temperature for the las 2 days of November 2020. Present the daily breakdown and the mean value at the end.
AIMessage: Okay, I will retrieve the outdoor temperature for the last two days of November 2020, present the daily breakdown, and then calculate the mean value. I will use the `weather_agent` for this.


ToolMessage: Successfully transferred to weather_agent
AIMessage: Here is the weather data for the last two days of November 2020 in Madrid:

*   **2020-11-29:** Min 4.5Â°C, Max 12.1Â°C
*   **2020-11-30:** Min 4.0Â°C, Max 13.9Â°C

To calculate the average temperature, I'll average the min and max temperatures for each day and then average those two values.

*   **2020-11-29 Avg:** (4.5 + 12.1) / 2 = 8.3Â°C
*   **2020-11-30 Avg:** (4.0 + 13.9) / 2 = 8.95Â°C

**Mean Value:** (8.3 + 8.95) / 2 = 8.625Â°C

Therefore, the average outdoor temperature for the last two days of November 2020 in Madrid was approximately 8.625Â°C.
