# scenario_10
# difficulty: easy
# type: temperature querying
# requires: weather_agent, calculator_agent
Retrieve the average outdoor temperature for the las 2 days of November 2024. Present the daily breakdown and the mean value at the end. Use weather information only.


# scenario_0
# difficulty: easy
# type: temperature querying
# requires: outdoor_temp
Retrieve the average outdoor temperature for Laboratory A for the second week of November 2024. Present the result in degrees Celsius and include the daily breakdown. No estimation or reasoning is required, just correct data retrieval and formatting.


# scenario_1
# difficulty: high
# type: multi-step estimation
# requires: occupancy_reasoning, indoor_temp, outdoor_temp, bibliographic_search
Estimate the heat generation produced by users in Laboratory A during November 2024. Use the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor sensors. Since no occupancy data is available, assume working hours between 08:00 and 18:00 on weekdays and mention this assumption. Before running the estimation, outline the full reasoning steps. Then execute them and finally search for scientific models of heat generation. Extract the most recent modelâ€™s formulation and compare it with your method.


# scenario_2
# difficulty: medium
# type: fallback reasoning
# requires: outdoor_temp, missing_data_detection
A malfunction in indoor sensors occurred during the second week of November 2024 in Laboratory B. Your task is to estimate the heat generated by people during this time, using only the outdoor temperature(Madrid temperature) and working hour assumptions. The system should detect the missing indoor data, explain the fallback used, and describe any limitations introduced.


# scenario_3
# difficulty: high
# type: literature-driven analysis
# requires: bibliographic_search, model_extraction, critical_comparison
You have to retrieve the most recent scientific model for human-generated heat in indoor environments from academic sources. Once retrieved, extract the mathematical formulation of the model. Then, explain how your own estimation pipeline aligns or diverges from this model, and discuss the implications for its applicability in Laboratory C.


# scenario_4
# difficulty: medium
# type: temporal analysis
# requires: temporal_reasoning, intermediate_reporting, presence_assumption
Analyze the cumulative thermal load generated by human activity in Laboratory D between 8:00 and 18:00 during working days in the second half of November 2024. The system should segment the timeline, apply the estimation iteratively, and report intermediate and final results. All steps must be explained in detail.
