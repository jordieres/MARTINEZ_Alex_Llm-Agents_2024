# scenario_5
# difficulty: medium
# type: weather
# requires: weather_agent, calculator_agent
Retrieve the temperature of Madrid for the last three days of July 2018. Include a breakdown of temperatures by hour for each day, and then compute the overall average.


# scenario_6
# difficulty: medium
# type: fallback reasoning
# requires: outdoor_temp, missing_data_detection
A malfunction in indoor sensors occurred during the second week of November 2024 in Laboratory B. Your task is to estimate the heat generated by people during this time and present it in degrees Celsius, using only the outdoor temperature in Madrid and working hour assumptions.


# scenario_7
# difficulty: medium-high
# type: temporal analysis
# requires: temporal_reasoning, intermediate_reporting, presence_assumption
Analyze the cumulative thermal load generated by human activity in Laboratory D between 8:00 and 18:00 during working days in the last two days of january 2024. All steps must be explained in detail.


# scenario_8
# difficulty: high
# type: literature-driven analysis
# requires: bibliographic_search, model_extraction, critical_comparison
You have to retrieve the most recent scientific model for human-generated heat in indoor environments from academic sources. Once retrieved, extract the mathematical formulation of the model. Then, explain how your own estimation pipeline aligns or diverges from this model, and discuss the implications for its applicability in Laboratory C.


# scenario_9
# difficulty: high
# type: multi-step estimation
# requires: occupancy_reasoning, indoor_temp, outdoor_temp, bibliographic_search
Estimate the heat generation produced by users in Laboratory A 5th to 9th of December 2024. Use the temperature difference between indoor sensors and outdoor temperature in Madrid. Since no occupancy data is available, assume working hours between 08:00 and 18:00 on weekdays. Then search for scientific models of heat generation. Extract the most recent modelâ€™s formulation and compare it with your method.
